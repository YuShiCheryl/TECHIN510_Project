# Study Group Matching Web App

A web-based platform designed to connect university students with compatible study partners and groups based on shared academic goals, schedules, and interests.

## Project Scope

This project aims to develop a comprehensive web application that facilitates meaningful connections between students through a sophisticated matching algorithm. The platform addresses the challenges of finding compatible study partners by considering multiple factors including academic focus, schedule availability, study style preferences, and proximity.

### Key Objectives:
- Create an intuitive platform for students to find ideal study partners based on comprehensive compatibility factors
- Match students according to schedules (日程安排), learning habits (学习习惯), location (地点), study methodology (学习方式), and personality traits (性格)
- Reduce academic isolation through meaningful peer connections
- Improve student engagement and academic performance through optimally matched study groups
- Foster a stronger sense of campus community
- Provide flexible scheduling and meeting coordination tools

## Target Users

### Primary Users:
- University and college students (both undergraduate and graduate)
- Students seeking academic collaboration
